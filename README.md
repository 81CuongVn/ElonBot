A Discord Bot that lets you stalk on a specific Twitter account that can notify you when a new tweet about a specific keyword is posted at any time of day every five minutes on any of your Discord servers.
This program primarily uses the *discord.py* and *tweepy* libraries and *Flask* for the http portion of the program. **Replit** is used to host the program, and  **UptimeRobot** is used to keep the bot running 24/7. 
 
  


## How to use:
1. First, use the command **"eb stalk"** and input a Twitter username after the command. 
	
	*(Enter only the twitter handle, refrain from using the **"@"** symbol.)*
2. Use the **"eb addkey"** command alongside with the keywords you wanted to search for one by one.

	*(Note: If you want to delete a keyword just type the command **"eb delkey"** with the keyword to be deleted.)*
3. If you are ready to monitor, you can now enter the command **"eb start"**. To stop the bot, enter the command **"eb stop"**
